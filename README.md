# Metastatic-Cancer-Prediction
Welcome to the Metastatic Cancer Prediction: 90-Day Breast Cancer Diagnoses Analysis project.

In this project, I focus on predicting whether patients diagnosed with breast cancer will receive a metastatic cancer diagnosis within 90 days of screening. To achieve this, I utilize a comprehensive dataset that encompasses various facets of patient information, including demographics, diagnosis details, treatment options, and insurance coverage. The data spans from 2015, providing a rich historical context for analysis.
I am excited to share my findings and contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance cancer diagnosis and patient outcomes.
